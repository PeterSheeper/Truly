				Spence, on loan at the City Ground from Middlesbrough, has caught the eye of a number of Premier League clubs. Arsenal are among them, after his standout display knocked Mikel Arteta's side out of the FA Cup. But, just as Spurs pipped their North London rivals into the top four, they are also set to steal Spence from under their noses too. Antonio Conte views him as a potential right wing-back upgrade as the Italian looks to invest heavily in his squad this summer.

				It is believed Conte is happy to let Emerson Royal leave and has made £15million Spence his prime target. Spence's ambition is to play at the highest level and Boro will sell to the highest bidder - Bayern Munich are said to have scouted the defender too. Brentford are another club in the race to sign Spence and believe he would fit their playing style perfectly. The Bees are also interested in another Forest star, Brennan Johnson, who has scored 18 league goals this season.
